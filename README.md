# Tourism Trend Analysis in Villa Carlos Paz

## Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of tourism trends in Villa Carlos Paz, one of the most important destinations in Córdoba province, Argentina. Using official data from the Household Travel and Tourism Survey (EVyTH) covering the period from 2012 to 2023, we explore tourist characteristics, their temporal and geographic distribution, seasonal patterns, and changes in age groups.

The main goal is to uncover tourist behavior patterns to provide information that supports strategic planning, local infrastructure optimization, and the design of sustainable tourism promotion policies.


## Objectives
- Identify socio-demographic characteristics of tourists (age group, province of origin, group size).
- Analyze seasonal and annual variations in tourist flows.
- Detect significant trends and changes in local tourism, especially related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Provide inputs for local economic and tourism planning.

## Data Source
- Source: Household Travel and Tourism Survey (EVyTH) - SINTA, Ministry of Tourism and Sports of Argentina.
- Period: 2012 - 2023.
- Sample size: Approximately 5,000 households surveyed quarterly.
- Key variables: region and province of origin, age groups, number of people per household, travel dates.

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand dataset structure and quality.
2. Segmentation by relevant provinces of origin.
3. Focus on Villa Carlos Paz as the main destination.
4. Selection of key variables for the study.
5. Seasonal quarterly and annual analysis.
6. Analysis of the evolution of socio-demographic variables and group size.

## Key Findings
- Confirmed high seasonality of tourism, with peaks in summer and low activity during other quarters.
- Most tourists come from Córdoba province, and groups are mainly small (2 to 4 people).
- Notable shift in age preferences, with an increase in tourists aged 60+ after the pandemic.
- General decline in tourism activity before the pandemic, without full recovery in subsequent years.
- Evident need to diversify the tourism offer to reduce dependence on seasonal peaks.

## Graphs and Visualizations

The `/graphs` folder contains the main visualizations illustrating the analysis results:

- **Tourist distribution by quarter and year:** Visualizing seasonality in tourist flows.  
- **Geographical origin of tourists:** Maps and bar charts showing visitor proportions by province.  
- **Age group evolution:** Temporal comparison of tourist percentages by age groups.
